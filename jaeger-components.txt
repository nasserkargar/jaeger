Jaeger Components

When deploying Jaeger Tracing, youâ€™ll need to address the following components:

    Agent is the component co-located with your application to gather the Jaeger trace data locally. It handles the connection and traffic control to the Collector (see below) as well as data enrichment.
    Collector is a centralized hub collecting traces from the various agents in the environment and sends for backend storage. The collector can run validations and enrichment on the spans.
    Query retrieves the traces and serves them over a UI.
